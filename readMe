## 📘 Project Overview

This project implements two **MapReduce-style systems** using **multithreading** in Python to demonstrate core **operating system concepts** such as parallelism, inter-process communication (IPC), and synchronization.

The system runs entirely on a single host machine and simulates a simplified MapReduce workflow using local parallel workers.  
Each task includes a **Map phase** (parallel computation) and a **Reduce phase** (aggregation of results).

## ⚙️ Tasks Implemented

### **1. Parallel Sorting**
- **Goal:** Sort a large array of integers using parallel workers.
- **Map Phase:** Divide the input array into equal chunks; each worker sorts its chunk using Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
- **Reduce Phase:** Merge all sorted chunks into one final sorted list.
- **Output:** Displays timing and memory metrics for 1, 2, 4, and 8 workers.

### **2. Max-Value Aggregation with Constrained Shared Memory**
- **Goal:** Find the global maximum value from a large dataset.
- **Constraint:** Shared memory only holds one integer (the global maximum).
- **Map Phase:** Each worker computes a local max and tries to update the shared value.
- **Reduce Phase:** The reducer reads the final maximum.
- **Synchronization:** Ensures only one worker updates the shared memory at a time using `threading.Lock()`.

## 🧩 Why Multithreading and Synchronization?

- **Multithreading** allows multiple workers to process data concurrently, improving performance on multi-core systems.
- **Synchronization** ensures correctness when shared data (like a global max) is accessed or updated by multiple threads.
- **MapReduce** provides a structured model for dividing work and combining results efficiently.
